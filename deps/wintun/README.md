# [Wintun Network Adapter](https://www.wintun.net/)
### TUN Device Driver for Windows

This is a layer 3 TUN driver for Windows 7, 8, 8.1, and 10. Originally created for [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/), it is intended to be useful to a wide variety of projects that require layer 3 tunneling devices with implementations primarily in userspace.

## Installation

Wintun is deployed as a platform-specific `wintun.dll` file. Install the `wintun.dll` file side-by-side with your application. Download the dll from [wintun.net](https://www.wintun.net/), alongside the header file for your application described below.

## Usage

Include the [`wintun.h` file](https://git.zx2c4.com/wintun/tree/api/wintun.h) in your project simply by copying it there and dynamically load the `wintun.dll` using [`LoadLibraryEx()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibraryexa) and [`GetProcAddress()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-getprocaddress) to resolve each function, using the typedefs provided in the header file. The [`InitializeWintun` function in the example.c code](https://git.zx2c4.com/wintun/tree/example/example.c) provides this in a function that you can simply copy and paste.

With the library setup, Wintun can then be used by first creating an adapter, and then starting a tunnel session on that adapter. Adapters have names (e.g. "OfficeNet"), and each one belongs to a _pool_ (e.g. "WireGuard"). So, for example, the WireGuard application app creates multiple tunnels all inside of its "WireGuard" _pool_:

```C
WINTUN_ADAPTER_HANDLE Adapter1 = WintunCreateAdapter(L"WireGuard", L"OfficeNet", &SomeFixedGUID1, NULL);
WINTUN_ADAPTER_HANDLE Adapter2 = WintunCreateAdapter(L"WireGuard", L"HomeNet", &SomeFixedGUID2, NULL);
WINTUN_ADAPTER_HANDLE Adapter3 = WintunCreateAdapter(L"WireGuard", L"Data Center", &SomeFixedGUID3, NULL);
```

After creating an adapter, we can use it by starting a session:

```C
WINTUN_SESSION_HANDLE Session = WintunStartSession(Adapter2, 0x400000);
```

Then, the `WintunAllocateSendPacket` and `WintunSendPacket` functions can be used for sending packets ([used by `SendPackets` in the example.c code](https://git.zx2c4.com/wintun/tree/example/example.c)):

```C
BYTE *OutgoingPacket = WintunAllocateSendPacket(Session, PacketDataSize);
if (OutgoingPacket)
{
    memcpy(OutgoingPacket, PacketData, PacketDataSize);
    WintunSendPacket(Session, OutgoingPacket);
}
else if (GetLastError() != ERROR_BUFFER_OVERFLOW) // Silently drop packets if the ring is full
    Log(L"Packet write failed");
```

And the `WintunReceivePacket` and `WintunReleaseReceivePacket` functions can be used for receiving packets ([used by `ReceivePackets` in the example.c code](https://git.zx2c4.com/wintun/tree/example/example.c)):

```C
for (;;)
{
    DWORD IncomingPacketSize;
    BYTE *IncomingPacket = WintunReceivePacket(Session, &IncomingPacketSize);
    if (IncomingPacket)
    {
        DoSomethingWithPacket(IncomingPacket, IncomingPacketSize);
        WintunReleaseReceivePacket(Session, IncomingPacket);
    }
    else if (GetLastError() == ERROR_NO_MORE_ITEMS)
        WaitForSingleObject(WintunGetReadWaitEvent(Session), INFINITE);
    else
    {
        Log(L"Packet read failed");
        break;
    }
}
```

Some high performance use cases may want to spin on `WintunReceivePackets` for a number of cycles before falling back to waiting on the read-wait event.

You are **highly encouraged** to read the [**example.c short example**](https://git.zx2c4.com/wintun/tree/example/example.c) to see how to put together a simple userspace network tunnel.

### Functions

#### WintunCreateAdapter()

`WINTUN_ADAPTER_HANDLE WintunCreateAdapter (const WCHAR * Pool, const WCHAR * Name, const GUID * RequestedGUID, BOOL * RebootRequired)`

Creates a new Wintun adapter.

**Parameters**

- *Pool*: Name of the adapter pool. Zero-terminated string of up to WINTUN\_MAX\_POOL-1 characters.
- *Name*: The requested name of the adapter. Zero-terminated string of up to MAX\_ADAPTER\_NAME-1 characters.
- *RequestedGUID*: The GUID of the created network adapter, which then influences NLA generation deterministically. If it is set to NULL, the GUID is chosen by the system at random, and hence a new NLA entry is created for each new adapter. It is called "requested" GUID because the API it uses is completely undocumented, and so there could be minor interesting complications with its usage.
- *RebootRequired*: Optional pointer to a boolean flag to be set to TRUE in case SetupAPI suggests a reboot.

**Returns**

If the function succeeds, the return value is the adapter handle. Must be released with WintunFreeAdapter. If the function fails, the return value is NULL. To get extended error information, call GetLastError.

Pointer to receive event handle to wait for available data when reading. Should WintunReceivePackets return ERROR\_NO\_MORE\_ITEMS (after spinning on it for a while under heavy load), wait for this event to become signaled before retrying WintunReceivePackets. Do not call CloseHandle on this event - it is managed by the session.

#### WintunReceivePacket()

`BYTE* WintunReceivePacket (WINTUN_SESSION_HANDLE Session, DWORD * PacketSize)`

Retrieves one or packet. After the packet content is consumed, call WintunReleaseReceivePacket with Packet returned from this function to release internal buffer. This function is thread-safe.

**Parameters**

- *Session*: Wintun session handle obtained with WintunStartSession
- *Packet*: Packet obtained with WintunAllocateSendPacket

## Building

**Do not distribute drivers or files named "Wintun", as they will most certainly clash with official deployments. Instead distribute [`wintun.dll` as downloaded from wintun.net](https://www.wintun.net).**

General requirements:

- [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) with Windows SDK 10.0.18362.0
- [Windows Driver Kit for Windows 10, version 1903](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk)

`wintun.sln` may be opened in Visual Studio for development and building. Be sure to run `bcdedit /set testsigning on` before to enable unsigned driver loading. The default run sequence (F5) in Visual Studio will build the example project.
